## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

-- My app is a trivia game based on the TV show "Breaking Bad" the game
    presents a quote and gives the user 3 characters to choose from.
    If the player is correct, the app will tell the user and give
    information about the character, including the actors name, birthday,
    and their picture. To start the game, the user must press the start button
    and when they want to move on to the next quote, they must press reset.
    The two API's that I am using are the Breaking Bad API and TV Maze API.
    They are connected to each other as the quote gives the author and I used
    the author to look into the TV Maze API, which contains all tv show information
    and I used their Breaking Bad information and used to quote's author to find
    information about the author such as the picture, actor, their birthday, and
    a picture of the actor. https://github.com/guccijason/cs1302-api



## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

-- I learned a lot more about JSON and GSON. An exciting thing that I learned was having fun
    creating a game about a show I really enjoyed. I learned how to connect multiple API's
    together and make it work with the buttons.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

-- If I had to start over, I would have made it where when the user gets
    the right answer the entire app scene would change and it would be a
    full text page that not only would give the author, birthday, and their
    picture, but all their episode appearances as well.
